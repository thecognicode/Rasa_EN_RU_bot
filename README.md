# Rasa Language Learning Chatbot: English-Russian Vocabulary Practice

This bot is designed to help you practice translating English to Russian. Whether you're just starting out or want to refresh your skills, the chatbot makes learning fun and interactive.

The way it works is simple: youâ€™ll be given an English word to translate into Russian. If you get it right, awesome! If not, no worriesâ€”the bot will gently correct you and keep things moving so you can learn at your own pace. Itâ€™s all about making language practice more engaging and less intimidating.

## What It Does

    Interactive Learning: The bot will give you English words to translate into Russian and give feedback based on your answers.

    Real-Time Feedback: If you make a mistake, the bot will kindly correct you and move on to the next word so you can keep learning.

    Flexible: Right now, itâ€™s set up for English to Russian, but you can easily switch it to Russian to English or any other language you want.
